                <p><strong><em>What is Press Advantage?</em></strong></p>
                <p>Press Advantage is a Full-Service Press Release distribution service.<br></p>
                <p>We have known about the power of press releases for years, but we realized that many businesses don&#x27;t have the internal know-how to write a press release. <br></p>
                <p>We created Press Advantage because businesses shouldn&#x27;t have to know how to write a press release. We&#x27;ll do that for you so you can get your news out there!</p>

                <p><strong><em>Who Are You Guys, Anyways?</em></strong></p>
                <p>We are Velluto Tech Incubator, an elite team founded in Las Vegas, Nevada in 2011. We build cloud-hosted software that helps businesses win new customers online.<br></p>
                <p>For the first few years, we focused mostly on Search Engine Optimization in all types of different niches. We learned the ins and outs of how to rank just about anything in Google, and built awesome software to help other people do it too. Over 1,000 businesses use our software to run their marketing.<br></p>
                <p>Now, one of the easiest ways to rank in Google is to submit a press release, and over the years, we tossed around the idea of starting our own Press Release distribution service. We like to do things a certain way to ensure great results, and most distribution companies just don&#x27;t do things the way we feel they should be done.<br></p>
                <p>When our customers get results, our own business succeeds. If that means we have to sell premium services at a discount, so be it. Our goal was to start from scratch and put together a press service that works really well for a reasonable price. But it doesn&#x27;t end there.<br></p>
                <p>Long story short, we built Press Advantage to be the most done-for-you press service that WE always dreamed of.</p>

                <p>If you own more than one company, you can absolutely use the unlimited account for any of them, or all of them.<br></p>
                <p>We will contact you if we believe that you are misusing an unlimited account, and we may cancel service or convert you to a standard rate account at our discretion.</p>

                <p>We recommend that you don&#x27;t use all 3 for SEO keywords though, because that can make your release look spammy. We recommend 1 brand link, 1 naked link (URL only), and 1 keyword link per release.</p>
